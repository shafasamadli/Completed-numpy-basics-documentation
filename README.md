# Completed-numpy-basics-documentation

This code parts, practices, notes are written and implemented based on official NUMPY Documentation.
We can find these them from this link: https://numpy.org/doc/stable/user/absolute_beginners.html
At the same time, inside of documentation we can find specific directors which contribute us to get more deeply information abouy Numpy constructions.
